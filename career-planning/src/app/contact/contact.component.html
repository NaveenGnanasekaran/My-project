    <p>Communication is the more important for the every field.Communication involves the concept of transfer of
        information. It is merely the act of sharing common ideas between individuals that are a part of the
        conversation. It forms an understanding from the sender to the receiver and vice versa. It is essential to carry
        out the process convincingly and meaningfully to develop an ideal conversation with communication. The act of
        communication is also known as the process of passing information in oral or written form.

    <p>It is the transfer of a personâ€™s thoughts in the way of talking or writing to another person. Communication has
        four actions that are, encoding, sending, receiving, and decoding. The sender encodes the information and
        transfers it to the receiver. The receiver gains the information from the sender, decodes it, and understands
        the message or information received. The message forms the content of the communication.</p>
