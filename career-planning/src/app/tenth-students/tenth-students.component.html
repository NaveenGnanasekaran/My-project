    <h1>After 10th?</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The <span>best time</span> to take a career aptitude test is after 10th and 12th, before you’ve chosen your
            career. That’s
            when things are less messy and the field is wide open to choose the relevant stream (science, commerce,
            arts, business etc) and right graduation degree.</p>

        <p>There are more career options after 10th and 12th before the broad career track has been chosen, than after
            graduation when the flexibility gets limited to the degree you get.</p>
        <p>But high school students are also more vulnerable. Subjected to parental and peer pressure, many end up
            taking careers just because they’ve been told to do so.</p>
        <p>Which is why we see the familiar and disturbing trend of parents pushing students to join entrance exams for
            several years. They assume sacrificing their childhood will someday bear fruit and get them happiness in
            life and career. But by the time students realize it, they’re stuck in the quicksand.</p>
        <p>
            Teens and students who take career tests after 10th and 12th are likely to be more aware of their choices.
        </p>
        <p>If you’ve gone beyond the high school, completed your college and already feel stuck in a bad career, it’s
            never too late. We have a free online aptitude test to help you get some basic answers.</p>
        <p>Our career finder for students and professionals has helped thousands of career explorers find the right
            career path for themselves. The result is shown as a simple chart and a list of careers, that easy to
            interpret and understand.</p>
